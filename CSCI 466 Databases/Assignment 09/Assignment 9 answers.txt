Assignment 9
section 3


Part 1
2) Nothing, because the first session has not finished and committed the information to memory yet.

5) It is the same because the first session was closed and committed before the second session's select statement was given.

Part 2
4) The movies at the position of 2 and 4 were updated to Iron Man and Con Air because they were updated.

5) It is the original list of movies because we started a transaction before we changed the movies so we were able to roll them back to that state.
